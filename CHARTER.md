# Nano Charter

## Mission

## Tenets (unless you know better ones)

These tenets guide Nanos' development:

1. **Security**:

Nanos aims to be a much more secure system than Linux. It does this
through several thrusts. Not having the notion of users, running a
single process per vm, and limiting the amount of code that is
incorporated into each vm.

2. **Minimalist**: 

KISS. As Nanos is not intended to be ran on bare metal we strive to keep
the core as simple as possible.

2. **Performance**: 

## Contributions & Project Roles

All contributions must align with this charter.
