__Roadmap__

This document is intended to track large features that are on the
engineering roadmap. This is not an authoritative document - we
obviously have internal project management/roadmaps. It's mainly here
just to reduce questions.

It should not be assumed that the architecture is 'set' based on this
roadmap. We have many other features that might appear down the road.

- [] AWS T series support
- [] AWS C series support
- [] Signals
- [] SMP
