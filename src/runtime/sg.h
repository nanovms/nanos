/* A scatter gather operation is a transaction that is divided into
   smaller transactions - each with two phases: request and
   completion. To begin, a transaction activation record and handle is
   allocated with allocate_sg_list. A consumer makes a request using
   the empty sg_list. On completion, the sg_list is filled with
   scatter-gather buffer data. As the consumer consumes buffers
   (sg_bufs), they are released with sg_buf_release - or the entire
   list and any unconsumed buffers are released at once with
   sg_list_release.

   A producing requester allocates the sg_list and populates it with
   scatter-gather buffer data before initiating a request. It must
   supply a refcount pointer for each buffer (which may all point to a
   single refcount for the request, essentially acting as a merge).
